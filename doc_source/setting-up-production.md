## Step 1: Install the RLM server<a name="install-rlm"></a>

When you purchase a perpetual license or subscription, you get a license file that defines the terms of your license\. You must install the license file on a Reprise License Manager \(RLM\) server\. 

For more information about RLM, see the [Reprise Software](http://www.reprisesoftware.com/products/license-manager.php) website\.

+ [Install the RLM server on Linux](#install-rlm-linux)

### Install the RLM server on Windows<a name="install-rlm-windows"></a>

**To install the RLM server on Windows**

1. Download the RLM License Administration Bundle from the [Reprise Software website](http://www.reprisesoftware.com/admin/software-licensing.php)\.
**Note**  
The installation of the latest stable version of the RLM license Administration Bundle is recommended\.

1. Install the RLM License Administration Bundle to `C:\RLM`\.

### Install the RLM server on Linux<a name="install-rlm-linux"></a>

**To install the RLM server on Linux**

1. Download the RLM License Administration Bundle from the [Reprise Software website](http://www.reprisesoftware.com/admin/software-licensing.php)\.
**Note**  
The installation of the latest stable version of the RLM license Administration Bundle is recommended\.

1. Create a user group and an `rlm` user\. This can be any valid user or service account\. We strongly recommend that you don't use the root account for this value\.

   ```
   $ groupadd -r rlm
   ```

   ```
   $ useradd -r -g rlm -d "/opt/nice/rlm" -s /sbin/nologin -c "RLM License Server" rlm
   ```

1. Create the `/opt/nice/rlm` and `/opt/nice/rlm/license` directories required for the RLM server\.

   ```
   $ mkdir -p /opt/nice/rlm/license
   ```

1. Extract the contents of the RLM License Administration Bundle to `/opt/nice/rlm/`, and ensure that the files are owned by the `rlm` user\.

   ```
   $ tar xvf x64_l1.admin.tar.gz -C /opt/nice/rlm/ --strip-components 1
   ```

   ```
   $ chown -R rlm:rlm /opt/nice/rlm
   ```

## Step 2: Get the host ID for the RLM server<a name="hostid-rlm"></a>

After you install the RLM server, you must get the RLM server's host ID\. You need to provide this host ID when purchasing a perpetual license or subscription\.

### Get the RLM server host ID on Windows<a name="hostid-rlm-windows"></a>

**To get the the host ID for the server, open the command prompt,**  
Navigate to `C:\RLM\`, and then run the following command\.

```
C:\> rlmutil.exe rlmhostid ether
```

The command returns the host ID for the RLM server is as follows\.

```
Hostid of this machine: 06814example
```

Make note of the host ID\. You need it for the next step\.

### Get the RLM server host ID on Linux<a name="hostid-rlm-linux"></a>

**To get the server's host ID, single return**

1. Navigate to `/opt/nice/rlm/`\.

1. Run the following command:

   ```
   $ ./rlmutil rlmhostid ether
   ```

   The command returns the RLM server's host ID for each network interface as follows\.

1. Record the host ID\. You need it for the next step\.

**Example**  
This procedure was run and the following single ID was returned:  

```
Hostid of this machine: 0a1b2c3d4e5f
```
This ID is then recorded and will be used to purchase the license for DCV\.

**To get the server's host ID, multiple returns**

1. Navigate to `/opt/nice/rlm/`\.

1. Run the following command:

   ```
   $ ./rlmutil rlmhostid ether
   ```

   Multiple IDs will be returned in a list of IDs\.

1. Run the following command\.

   ```
   iface=$(route -n | grep " UG " | tr -s " " | cut -d" " -f8)
   ip link show $iface | grep link/ether | tr -s " " | cut -d" " -f3 | tr -d ":"
   ```

   The command should return the RLM server's host ID for the Gateway network interface\. 

1. Record the host ID\. You need it for the next step\.

**Example**  
The procedure was run and multiple IDs were returned in a list of multiple IDâ€™s:  

```
Hostid of this machine: 0a1b2c3d4e5f 1b2c3d4e5f6a 2c3d4e5f6a7b 3d4e5f6a7b8c
```
The interface command is run and returns the following ID:  

```
Hostid of this machine: 0a1b2c3d4e5f
```
This ID is then recorded and will be used to purchase the license for DCV\.

## Step 3: Purchase the perpetual license or subscription<a name="license-purchase"></a>

For information about how to purchase a NICE DCV perpetual license or a subscription, see [How to Buy](https://www.nice-software.com/index.html#buy) on the NICE website and find a NICE distributor or reseller in your region\.

You must provide the host ID for your RLM server\. The host ID is embedded in the license file that NICE provides\.

## Step 4: Modify the license file<a name="setting-up-production-license-file"></a>

When you purchase a NICE DCV perpetual license or subscription, you receive a `license.lic` file that defines the license\. The `license.lic` file includes the following information:
+ The hostname of the RLM server\.
+ The host ID of the RLM server that you provided when you purchased the license\.
+ The TCP port number of the RLM server\. The default is `5053`\.
+ The ISV port number\. This is an optional port where the RLM server listens for NICE DCV license requests\. If not specified a random port is picked by RLM at startup\.
+ The NICE DCV products covered by the license, along with the following details for each product:
  + The major version that's covered by the license \(for example, `2017` for the 2017 NICE DCV products\)\.
  + The expiration date\. `Permanent` indicates that the license doesn't expire\.
  + The maximum number of concurrent sessions \(for example, `10` for 10 concurrent sessions on the server\)\.
  + The license checksum\.
  + The license signature\.

The following code block shows the format of the `license.lic` file:

```
HOST RLM_server_hostname RLM_server_host_id RLM_server_port
ISV nice port=port_number
LICENSE product_1 major_version expiration_date concurrent_sessions share=hi _ck=checksum sig="signature"
LICENSE product_2 major_version expiration_date concurrent_sessions share=hi _ck=checksum sig="signature"
```

The following code block shows an example of a `license.lic` file with the ISV port omitted\. The license file includes licenses for two NICE products, DCV and dcv\-gl\.

```
HOST My-RLM-server abcdef123456 5053
ISV nice
LICENSE nice dcv 2017 permanent 10 share=hi _ck=456789098a sig="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890ab"
LICENSE nice dcv-gl 2017 permanent 10 share=hi _ck=123454323x sig="1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz12"
```

**To edit the `license.lic` file**

1. Open the file with your preferred text editor\.

1. Add your RLM server's hostname and the TCP port number to the first line in the file, which starts with `HOST`\.
**Warning**  
The *RLM\_server\_host\_id* is the host ID that you provided when you purchased the license\. You cannot edit the *RLM\_server\_host\_id*\.

1. \(Optional\) Add the ISV port number in the line in file which starts with `ISV`, by adding `port=port_number`\. This port is required to enable communication with the DCV server\. 

   If you don't want to specify an ISV port, omit `port=port_number`\. If you don't specify an ISV port, a random port is used by RLM at each startup\. 
**Warning**  
If you have a firewall setup preventing the use of a randomly selected port, you need to specify this port and configure the firewall to enable it, in addition to the RLM port specified in the `HOST` line\. 

1. Save and close the file\.

**Warning**  
Editing any other part of the license file corrupts the file's signature and invalidates the license\.

## Step 5: Configure the RLM Server<a name="setting-up-rlm-server"></a>

After you modified the license file, you must place it on your RLM server and then start the RLM service\.

+ [Configure the RLM server on Linux](#prep-linux)

### Configure the RLM Server on Windows<a name="prep-windows"></a>

**To configure the RLM server on Windows**

1. Connect to your RLM server\.

1. Copy the edited `license.lic` file to `C:\RLM\license\`\.

1. Copy the `C:\Program Files\NICE\DCV\Server\license\nice.set` file from your NICE DCV server and place it in the `C:\RLM\` folder on your RLM server\.

1. Install the RLM server as a Windows service\.

   ```
   C:\> rlm.exe -nows -dlog C:\RLM\rlm.log -c C:\RLM\license -install_service -service_name dcv-rlm
   ```

   For more information about the RLM startup options, see the [RLM License Administration Manual](http://www.reprisesoftware.com/RLM_Enduser.html)\.

1. Start the RLM server\.

   ```
   C:\> net start dcv-rlm
   ```

1. Confirm that the RLM server is running\.

   1. Open `C:\RLM\nice.dlog` with your preferred text editor and confirm that the following line appears\.

      ```
      date_time (nice) Server started on license1 (hostid: host_id) for: dcv dcv-gl
      ```
**Note**  
The contents of the `rlm.log` file might vary slightly depending on the RLM server version\.

   1. Run the following command\.

      ```
      C:\RLM\rlmutil rlmstat -a -c rlm_server_hostname@5053
      ```

      The command returns information about the RLM server\.

### Configure the RLM server on Linux<a name="prep-linux"></a>

**To configure the RLM server on Linux**

1. Copy the edited `license.lic` file to `/opt/nice/rlm/license/`\.

1. Copy the `/usr/share/dcv/license/nice.set` file from your NICE DCV server and place it in `/opt/nice/rlm` on your RLM server\.

1. Create an RLM server service and make sure that it starts automatically at startup\.

   1. Create a file named `dcv-rlm` in the `/opt/nice/rlm/` folder:

      ```
      $ touch /opt/nice/rlm/dcv-rlm
      ```

   1. Open the file using your preferred text editor and add the following script\. Save and close the file\.

      esac
      
      exit $?
      
      # ex:ts=4:et:
      ```

   1. Make the script executable, copy it to `/etc/init.d/`, and then add it to the `chkconfig` utility:

      ```
      chmod +x /opt/nice/rlm/dcv-rlm 
      ```

      ```
      cp -a /opt/nice/rlm/dcv-rlm /etc/init.d/
      ```

      ```
      chkconfig --add dcv-rlm
      ```

1. Start the RLM server:

   ```
   $ service dcv-rlm start
   ```

1. Verify that the RLM server is running and functioning as expected\. Open `var/log/rlm.log` with your preferred text editor and confirm that the following line appears:

   ```
   date_time (nice) Server started on license1 (hostid: host_id) for: dcv dcv-gl
   ```
**Note**  
The contents of the `rlm.log` file might vary slightly depending on the RLM server version\.

## Step 6: Configure the NICE DCV Server<a name="setting-up-dcv-server"></a>

Configure your NICE DCV server to use the RLM server\. To do this, you must configure the `license-file` configuration parameter on your NICE DCV server\.

 The `license-file` parameter must be set with the specification of the RLM server to connect to, in the format `RLM_server_port@RLM_server`\. The RLM server can be either specified as a hostname or as an IP address\. If not configured explicitly, the RLM server port is by default `5053`\. 

 In case multiple RLM servers are in use, you can specify a list of multiple RLM servers specifications, separated by `:` on Linux, by `;` on Windows\. Then the server will try to connect to each one in turn, until one connection can be established with the corrresponding RLM server\. This can be especially useful for example when using an RLM failover server to take over in case the primary RLM server is not reachable\. In this case you can specify the license in the format: `RLM_primary_server_port@RLM_primary_server:RLM_failover_server_port@RLM_failover_server` 

**Note**  
In case the NICE DCV Server is installed on Windows, you need to separate the entries in the specification with `;`\.

+ [Linux NICE DCV Server configuration](#config-linux)

### Windows NICE DCV Server configuration<a name="config-win"></a>

**To configure the `license-file` configuration parameter on a Windows server**

1. Open the Windows Registry Editor\.

1. Navigate to the **HKEY\_USERS/S\-1\-5\-18/Software/GSettings/com/nicesoftware/dcv/license/** key and select the **license\-file** parameter\.

   If there is no `license-file` parameter in the registry key, you must create it:

   1. Open the context \(right\-click\) menu for the **license** key in the left pane and choose **New**, **String Value**\.

   1. For **Name**, enter `license-file` and press **Enter**\.

1. Open the **license\-file** parameter\. For **Value data**, enter the RLM server's port number and hostname in the `RLM_server_port@RLM_server` format\. Check the note above if you need to setup connection to multiple RLM servers\. 

1. Choose **OK** and close the Windows Registry Editor\.

### Linux NICE DCV Server configuration<a name="config-linux"></a>

**To configure the `license-file` configuration parameter on a Linux server**

1. Navigate to `/etc/dcv/` and open the `dcv.conf` with your preferred text editor\.

1. Locate the `license-file` parameter in the `[license]` section\. Then, replace the existing path with the port and hostname of the RLM server in the `RLM_server_port@RLM_server` format\.

   If there is no `license-file` parameter in the `[license]` section, add it manually using the following format:

   ```
   license-file = "RLM_server_port@RLM_server"
   ```

   Check the note above if you need to setup connection to multiple RLM servers\.

1. Save and close the file\.
