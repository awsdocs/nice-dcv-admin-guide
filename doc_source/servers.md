## Requirements<a name="requirements"></a>

For a good user experience with NICE DCV, ensure that your server meets the following minimum requirements\. Keep in mind that your users' experience is largely dependent on the number of pixels streamed from the NICE DCV server to the NICE DCV client\.

If you are installing the NICE DCV server on an Amazon EC2 instance, we recommend that you use an Amazon EC2 G3, G4dn, or G4ad instance type\. These instance types offer GPUs that support hardware\-based OpenGL and GPU sharing\. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 G3 Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g3/) and [Amazon EC2 G4 Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g4/)\. You can install the NICE DCV server on any other instance type, but there might be screen resolution limitations\. To bypass this limitation, download and install the [ NICE DCV Virtual Display Driver for EC2](https://d1uj6qtbmh3dt5.cloudfront.net/Drivers/nice-dcv-virtual-display-x64-Release-38.msi)\.

Your server must meet the minimum requirements listed in the following table\.
