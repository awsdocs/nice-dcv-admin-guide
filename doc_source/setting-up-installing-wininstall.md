Use the NICE DCV server installation wizard for a guided installation\.

**To install the NICE DCV server on Windows using the wizard**

1. Launch and connect to the server on which to install the NICE DCV server\.

1. Download the NICE DCV server installer from the [NICE DCV](http://download.nice-dcv.com) website\.
**Note**  
The NICE DCV server is available only in a 64\-bit version and supported on 64\-bit Windows operating systems\.
**Tip**  
The [latest packages](http://download.nice-dcv.com/latest.html) page of the download website contains links that always point to the newest available version\. You can use these links to automatically retrieve the newest NICE DCV packages\.

1. Run `nice-dcv-server-x64-Release-2023.0-version_number.msi`\. 

1. On the Welcome screen, choose **Next**\.

1. On the End\-User License Agreement screen, read the license agreement\. If you accept the terms, select the **I accept the terms in the License Agreement** check box, and then choose **Next**\.

1. \(Optional\) configure which components will be installed by selecting items in the **Components Selection** screen\. To mark a component for installation, select the item and choose **Will be installed on local hard drive**\. To omit a component from the installation select the item and choose **Entire feature will be unavailable**\.

1. On the DCV Service Configuration screen:

   1. \(Optional\) To manually configure your server's firewall to allow communication over the required port, select **No, I will manually configure my firewall later**\.

   1. \(Optional\) To manually start the NICE DCV server after the installation, select **No, I want to start a DCV Service manually**\. If you select this option, you can't start a console session automatically after the installation is complete\. If you select this option, step 9 is skipped\.

1. Choose **Next**\.

1. On the DCV Session Management Configuration screen, specify the owner for the automatic console session\. Or, to prevent the automatic console session from starting after the installation is complete, select **No, I will create the session manually**\.
**Note**  
Complete this step only if you previously chose to allow the server to start automatically\.

1. Choose **Install**\.

## Unattended installation<a name="setting-up-installing-windows-unattended"></a>

By default, the unattended installation does the following:
+ Adds a firewall rule to allow communication over port 8443\.
+ Enables NICE DCV server auto\-start\.
+ Creates an automatic console session\.
+ Sets the console session owner to the user who performs the installation\.

You can override the default actions by appending the following options to the installation command:
+ `DISABLE_FIREWALL=1` — Prevents the installer from adding the firewall rule\.
+ `DISABLE_SERVER_AUTOSTART=1` — Prevents the NICE DCV server from starting automatically after the installation\.
+ `DISABLE_AUTOMATIC_SESSION_CREATION=1` — Prevents the installer from starting the automatic console session\.
+ `AUTOMATIC_SESSION_OWNER=owner_name` — Specifies a different owner for the automatic console session\.
+ `ADDLOCAL=component_list` — Adds elements to the set of elements to be installed\.
+ `REMOVE=component_list` — Removes elements from the set of elements to be installed\.
**Note**  
The `REMOVE` option is evaluated after the `ADDLOCAL` option\. An element that's on both lists isn't installed\.

The component\_list is a comma\-separated list that can contain the following values:
+ `audioMicDriver`: Microphone driver
+ `audioSpkDriver`: Speaker driver
+ `printerDriver`: Printer driver
+ `usbDriver`: USB device remotization driver \(Disabled by default\)
+ `webcamDriver`: Webcam driver
+ `gamepadDriver`: Gamepad driver
+ `webClient`: Web client
+ `ALL`: All components
