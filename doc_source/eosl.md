# NICE DCV end of support life<a name="eosl"></a>

The NICE DCV End of Support Life \(EOSL\) defines the point in time after which a specific major version \(and all of its minor versions\) of NICE DCV no longer receives support and is no longer tested for compatibility with newer versions\.

Before the EOSL date, the NICE DCV support team continues to provide full support for configuration issues\. Defect resolutions and feature requests are implemented for the most recent versions of the NICE DCV server and NICE DCV client only\. They are not implemented for older versions\.

After the EOSL date, no further support or maintenance is provided\. We will also stop testing for compatibility issues\. For continued support, you must upgrade to the latest NICE DCV version\.
