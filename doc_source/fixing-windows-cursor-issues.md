# Fixing Cursor Issues on Windows<a name="fixing-windows-cursor-issues"></a>

With NICE DCV servers running on Windows Server 2012 or Windows 8 and later, the mouse cursor always appears as an arrow\. This happens even when pausing on text entry fields or single\-click navigation items\. This could happen if there is no physical mouse attached to the server, or if there is no mouse device listed in Device Manager\.

**To resolve the issue**

1. Open Control Panel, and choose **Ease of Access Center**\.

1. Choose **Make the mouse easier to use**\.

1. Select **Turn on Mouse Keys**\. 

1. Choose **Apply**, **OK**\.
