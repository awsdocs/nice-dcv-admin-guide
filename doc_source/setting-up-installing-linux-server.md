   ```
   $ sudo rpm --import https://d1uj6qtbmh3dt5.cloudfront.net/NICE-GPG-KEY
   ```

1. Download the packages from the [NICE website](http://download.nice-dcv.com)\. The RPM and deb packages are packaged into a `.tgz` archive\. Ensure that you download the correct archive for your operating system\.

   ```
   $ wget https://d1uj6qtbmh3dt5.cloudfront.net/2020.1/Servers/nice-dcv-2020.1-8942-el6-x86_64.tgz
   ```

1. Extract the contents of the `.tgz` archive\.

   ```
   $ tar -xvzf nice-dcv-2020.1-8942-el6-x86_64.tgz
   ```

1. Navigate into the extracted folder\.

   ```
   $ cd nice-dcv-2020.1-8942-el6-x86_64
